# About Me

<p style="font-size: 14pt">I'm a third-year Computer Science student at Columbia University, currently
working at the intersection of data science, medicine and statistics. I previously worked in the Naresh Kumar lab at the University of Miami (FL), where I discovered my interests in public health, medicine and oncology, and now I'm exploring the field of biotech venture and healthcare economics! In my freetime I love trying new foods, learning languages, coding projects and basketball!</p>
